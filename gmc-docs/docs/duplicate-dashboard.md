## Duplicate dashboard

At the end of the survey, a dashboard with the respondants scores is displayed to the user.

If a new survey is created, a new dashboard needs to be created, and linked to the survey.

Metabase does not have a feature to copy dashboards, but we have prepared a small application which copies dashboards.

Please let us know if you want a dashboard duplicating.
