## Sharing dashboard for use in LimeSurvey

Users are shown a chart of their Framework scores in the 'End Message'.  This chart is powered by Metabase.

In order to display the chart in LimeSurvey, we need to [enable embedding charts and dashboards on metabase](https://metabase.com/docs/v0.23.0/administration-guide/13-embedding.html).

This only needs to be done for new dashboards.
