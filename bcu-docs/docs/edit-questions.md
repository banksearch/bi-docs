## How to edit questions

The questions in the survey can be edited, see: [Edit question](https://manual.limesurvey.org/Edit_question).

Questions have been grouped into [Groups](https://manual.limesurvey.org/Question_groups_-_introduction), which separate the questions across a number of pages.  The Questions and Question Groups can be [reordered](https://manual.limesurvey.org/Survey_structure#Reordering_questions_and_question_groups).

## Expression Manager

The results for the Framework sections are calculated using LimeSurvey's [Expression Manager](https://manual.limesurvey.org/Expression_Manager), in particular, the question type: [Equation](https://manual.limesurvey.org/Expression_Manager#Equations_2).

Each Framework has 5 equations needed to calculate the Framework section's:

- label (for the dashboard)
- score
- percent
- report header
- report text
