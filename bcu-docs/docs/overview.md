## SME Online Diagnostic System Overview

The SME Online Diagnostic System will enable you to quickly, efficiently and accurately capture survey responses, process, store, manage, analyse and distribute personalised reports to your clients, giving you the ability to amend your survey questions and reports and facilitate data discovery and visualisation.

We have pulled together a solution using popular open source tools, LimeSurvey and Metabase powered on the Microsoft Azure platform.

Using LimeSurvey we are able to:

- Create a survey to capture data inputs
- Use the 'expression manager' to calculate the participants' scores "on the fly"
- Multi-lingual surveys with an ['auto-translate'](https://manual.limesurvey.org/Quick-translation) feature
- Multiple iterations of the survey
- Build participant's report
- Email participant's report

We use Metabase to:

- Build charts & dashboards to analyse responses
- Embed charts & dashboards in participant's reports

## Documentation

Both LimeSurvey and Metabase have excellent documentation.  Througout this documentation we link directly to the respective sites, and only add detail where it will add value.
