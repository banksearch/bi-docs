# Introduction

## BCU-Survey

[BCU-Survey URL](https://bcu-survey.growmycompany.co.uk)

### Survey Access

The survey is secured with a [participant list](https://manual.limesurvey.org/Survey_participants#Introduction).

New users of the survey can register to complete the survey, and return to it later.

A user can only register once per survey.  
In order to access the survey more than once when your email address has been used, you can either:

1. use another email account
2. use a 'token'
3. eventually you will learn to clear out the participant list / remove single records

#### Using tokens

I will provide you with a list of tokens. Each token can only be used once.

Replace the string `< your token here >` in this URL, and then navigate to the URL:
`https://bcu-survey.growmycompany.co.uk/index.php/692579?token=< your token here >&newtest=Y&lang=en`

A correct URL looks like: `https://bcu-survey.growmycompany.co.uk/index.php/692579?token=sEPydPwx9Xh4q1C&newtest=Y&lang=en`
